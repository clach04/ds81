/* Don't know whether I have a problem with my DS or the library, but sometimes
   the touchscreen value is off (one co-ord generally completely out).

   To alleviate this, and as this is a simple touch screen keyboard, allow
   touchs to be averaged if the config says so.  And averaged touch just means
   that two touchs have to happen within 5 pixels on X and Y before being
   allowed.

   If not configured to average, this simply reads the touchscreen position
   and returns true.
