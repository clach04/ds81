   an externally visible Z80Byte array called Z80_MEMORY must be
   defined.  The macros RAMBOT and RAMTOP define the writable area of
   memory and must be changed accordingly.

   In this mode the signature of Z80Init changes so that the memory functions
   are not passed.  ALL processor instances share the same memory.
