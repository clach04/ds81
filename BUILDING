Build Instructions
------------------

As this uses the example makefiles from devkitpro, all that is required is
a 'make' command in the top level directory:

$ make


By default FAT support will be initialised.  To prevent this you need to supply
additional flag settings:

$ make ADDITIONAL_CFLAGS="-DDS81_DISABLE_FAT"


There is a script mkrelease.sh which simply makes a FAT and non-FAT version of
DS81 for release.  This script also sets the displayed version number to the
string contained in the 'version' file (by default a time-stamp is produced).
