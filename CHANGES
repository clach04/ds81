+ Completed
* In progress
- Abandoned.

Changes from V1.0 to V1.1

    +	Added external FAT file loading.
    +	Added Mazogs as a built-in tape (code courtesy of Paul Fearnley)
    +	Fixed bug where the ROM input routine could be easily locked up.
    	This was caused by a problem in the way I set up the LASTK system
	variables from the house-keeping routine.


Changes from V1.1 to V1.1a (uncontrolled release).

    +	Fixed hideous mess up that was the keyboard fix.

Changes from V1.1a to V1.2

    +	Controlled version of keyboard fix.
    -	Added seperate ARM7/ARM9 code so I could use Wifi to use a web server
        as a file store.  Wifi lib doesn't work with my access point, so
	reverted to a simpler ARM9 build.  Which has made a merry mess of the
	CVS repository.
    +	Compiled with newer version of libfat so that the DLDI interfaces can
    	be used (thanks Chism!)  At last I can load ZX81 programs into my own
	damned emulator!  Moved to R20 of the toolchain and the new libnds.
    +	Added support for text mode underlayed with a rotation screen for bitmap
    	purposes.
    +	Added code to ZX81 emulation to notice changes to I register and search
    	for hires display files.  Works for a lot of hires games, though needs
	proper display emulation for Manic Miner, so that won't work :-(
    +	Improved speed of hi-res code.
    +	Fixed attempted load in ZX81SNAP -- the FAT libs seem to want UNIX style
    	directory seperators.
    +	Added file selector with LOAD "*"
    +	Handling of 1K display files is a bit better.
    +	Added option for RAM in place of ROM mirror.
    +	Changed lower screen to 8-bit deep so I can overlay a tiled mode.
    +	Added lower screen console routines.
    +	Added Machine Code Monitor.

Changes from V1.2 to V1.2a

    +	Made file selector filter case-insensitive.

Changes from V1.2a to V1.3

    +	Added memory snapshots.
    +	Added auto-load of AUTO snapshot.
    +	Added save/load of keyboard mappings.
    +	Added ability to SAVE from BASIC.
    +	Increased maximum number of files to 1024 in selector.
    *	Forty Niner still goes mental, so there's still an emulation bug
    	somewhere.
